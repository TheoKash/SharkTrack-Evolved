'''
Script to clip YOLO bounding box labels to ensure they stay within image boundaries.
Assumes labels are in YOLO format: <class> <x_center> <y_center> <width> <height>

This is needed because annotated labels can sometimes extend beyond image edges,
which can cause issues during training or evaluation.
